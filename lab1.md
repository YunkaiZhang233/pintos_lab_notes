## Task 1: Booting Pintos

### Exercise 1.1

1.  
    Have Pintos development environment setup as described in [Environment Setup](https://alfredthiel.gitbook.io/pintosbook/getting-started/environment-setup).
2.  
    Afterwards, execute

    ```bash
    cd pintos/src/threads
    make
    cd build
    pintos --
    ```

    If everything works, you should see Pintos booting in the [QEMU emulator](https://www.qemu.org), and print `Boot complete` near the end.

    While by default we run Pintos in QEMU, Pintos can also run in the [Bochs](https://bochs.sourceforge.io) and VMWare Player emulator. Bochs will be useful for the Lab1: Threads. 

    To run Pintos with Bochs, execute

    ```bash
    cd pintos/src/threads
    make
    cd build
    pintos --bochs --
    ```

> Take screenshots of the successful booting of Pintos in QEMU and Bochs.

#### My Records

Well this is basically following-steps-and-mimicing. Should be simple.

Created shorthand for starting pintos (i.e., used `alias` linux utility and updated `docker run -it --rm --name pintos --mount type=bind,source=absolute/path/to/pintos/on/your/host/machine,target=/home/PKUOS/pintos pkuflyingpig/pintos bash` to an alias of `pintos-up` in order to avoid tedious memorizing).

## Task 2: Debugging

### Exercise 2.1

**While you are working on the projects, you will frequently use the GNU Debugger (GDB) to help you find bugs in your code.** Make sure you read the [Debugging](https://alfredthiel.gitbook.io/pintosbook/getting-started/debug-and-test/debugging) section first.

In addition, if you are unfamiliar with **x86 assembly**, the [PCASM](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~huang/cs318/fall21/project/specs/pcasm-book.pdf) is an excellent book to start. Note that you don't need to read the entire book, just the basic ones are enough.

> Your first task in this section is to  use GDB to trace the QEMU BIOS a bit to understand how an IA-32 compatible computer boots. Answer the following questions in your design document:
>
> - What is the first instruction that gets executed?
> - At which physical address is this instruction located?

### Notes and Answers 2.1

Operations: just follow the steps. Trivial.

Starting `gdb` as instructed will automatically lead us to having executed `target remote localhost:1234` via calling `debugpintos`.

The first piece of information displayed:

```plain
(gdb) debugpintos
The target architecture is assumed to be i8086
[f000:fff0]    0xffff0: ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
```

Hence the first instruction get executed is `ljmp`, located at physical address `0x0000fff0`.

### Exercise 2.2

> **Trace the Pintos bootloader** and answer the following questions in your design document:
>
> - How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?
> - How does the bootloader decide whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?
> - What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?
> - At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

#### Tips

- In the second task, you will be tracing the Pintos bootloader. **Set a breakpoint at address `0x7c00`, which is where the boot sector will be loaded.** Continue execution until that breakpoint.
- Trace through the code in `threads/loader.S`, using the source code and the disassembly file `threads/build/loader.asm` to keep track of where you are.
- Also, **use the `x/i` command** in GDB to disassemble sequences of instructions in the boot loader, and compare the original boot loader source code with both the disassembly in threads/build/loader.asm and GDB.

### Notes and Answers 2.2

Invoke `gdb` and set a breakpoint at `0x7c00`. Following 2.1, we will issue these commands:

```plain
(gdb) debugpintos
The target architecture is assumed to be i8086
[f000:fff0]    0xffff0: ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b
0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
(gdb) b *0x7c00
Breakpoint 1 at 0x7c00
(gdb) continue
Continuing.
[   0:7c00] => 0x7c00:  sub    %eax,%eax

Breakpoint 1, 0x00007c00 in ?? ()
```

#### General Tips for this Exercise

- **read THROUGH the codes** in `loader.S`.
- And also read the comments. They are quite self-explanatory.
- For this exercise, [The JHU Project 0](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~huang/cs318/fall21/project/project0.html) provides a more detailed explanation.
- For a list of Interruptions, see the referenced [Ralf Brown's Interrupt List](https://www.ctyme.com/rbrown.htm) (i.e., `IntrList`).

> How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

At this point, Bootloader has taken control from BIOS and the instructions to be executed correspond to the ones in `loader.S`.

We will refer to `loader.S` and the corresponding `loader.asm` for code tracing.

From `loader.asm`: address `0x00007c00` corresponds to `<read_mbr>`. Leading us back to the part in `loader.S`: it starts at `line 51` and then calls `read_sector`.

Trace to `read_sector`: Here are its comments:

```assembly
#### Sector read subroutine.  Takes a drive number in DL (0x80 = hard
#### disk 0, 0x81 = hard disk 1, ...) and a sector number in EBX, and
#### reads the specified sector into memory at ES:0000.  Returns with
#### carry set on error, clear otherwise.  Preserves all
#### general-purpose registers.
```

We can see the major functionality of `read_sector` is to enable addressing mode switching via interruption and set flags. By viewing its code:

```assembly
read_sector:
    pusha
    sub %ax, %ax
    push %ax   # LBA sector number [48:63]
    push %ax   # LBA sector number [32:47]
    push %ebx   # LBA sector number [0:31]
    push %es   # Buffer segment
    push %ax   # Buffer offset (always 0)
    push $1    # Number of sectors to read
    push $16   # Packet size
    mov $0x42, %ah   # Extended read
    mov %sp, %si   # DS:SI -> packet
    int $0x13   # Error code in CF
    popa    # Pop 16 bytes, preserve flags
```

We can see the Error Code in CF is `0x13` with having the `ah` parameter as `0x42`. By referring to the [BIOS Interrupt Call Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_interrupt_call), I noticed that:

> The interrupt number is specified as the parameter of the software interrupt instruction (in Intel assembly language, an "`INT`" instruction), and the function number is specified in the `AH` register; that is, the caller sets the `AH` register to the number of the desired function. In general, the BIOS services corresponding to each interrupt number operate independently of each other, but the functions within one interrupt service are handled by the same BIOS program and are not independent.

This further confirmed by hypothetical guess and by referencing the interruption table, we found that the specific interrupt used is `Extended Read Sectors`.

---

> How does the bootloader decide whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

This time we turn back to the codes in `loader.S` for `read_mbr`. (FYI: `mbr` stands for `Master Boot Records`).

Notice in the parts covered by the previous question, `read_sector` modified error code in `CF` (`int $0x13`).

Follow through the code, `jc no_such_drive` branches for drive read error. If no such error exists, status messages are printed to show the disk and partition being scanned.

Then:

```assembly
# Check for MBR signature--if not present, it's not a
# partitioned hard disk.
cmpw $0xaa55, %es:510
jne next_drive

mov $446, %si   # Offset of partition table entry 1.
mov $'1', %al
check_partition:
    # Is it an unused partition?
    cmpl $0, %es:(%si)
    je next_partition

    # Print [1-4].
    call putc

    # Is it a Pintos kernel partition?
    cmpb $0x20, %es:4(%si)
    jne next_partition

    # Is it a bootable partition?
    cmpb $0x80, %es:(%si)
    je load_kernel

next_partition:
    # No match for this partition, go on to the next one.
    add $16, %si			# Offset to next partition table entry.
    inc %al
    cmp $510, %si
    jb check_partition
```

So the `MBR` should have the feature of ending with `0xaa55` at address `%es:510` (`510 = 0x1FE`).
If the bits recorded does not match, the bootloader will jump to the next drive to try again (`jne next_drive`).

Then jump to check partition records. (`offset = 446`). 

- If read result is zero, then this partition is apparently unused, hence will lead to next partition.
- Pintos kernel uses a type of `0x20` for partition type. (see comments before `read_mbr`) If not match: jump to next partition.
- Check the first byte of the value recorded in the current partition. If `0x80` is detected then this is bootable.

If all of the checks above are pass, then it means we have found the partition for Pintos kernel.

---

> What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

Read through the codes:

```assembly
next_partition:
    # No match for this partition, go on to the next one.
    add $16, %si        # Offset to next partition table entry.
    inc %al
    cmp $510, %si
    jb check_partition
next_drive:
    # No match on this drive, go on to the next one.
    inc %dl
    jnc read_mbr

no_such_drive:
no_boot_partition:
    # Didn't find a Pintos kernel partition anywhere, give up.
    call puts
    .string "\rNot found\r"

    # Notify BIOS that boot failed.  See [IntrList].
    int $0x18
```

`next_partition` will fall through to `next_drive` if partitions in current drive are all read. If all drives are read and no Pintos kernel is found, `jnc read_mbr` will not be executed and hence the program will fall through to `no_such_drive`, which further leads to falling through to `no_boot_partition` (no partition for booting is found). It will then output error message and return an interruption indicating [Interrupt 18](http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-2241.htm), no bootable disk available to the system.
